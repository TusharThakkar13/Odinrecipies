# Odinrecipies
This repository is created as a part of "The Odin Project" 's HTML Lesson project submission. This is a basic website of 3 recipies. In this project I learnt the use of the following html tags.
  1. Heading tag
  2. Ordered and unordered list tag
  3. anchor tag (attribute = href)
  4. image tag (attribute = src)
